# Security Whitepaper - dLNk Attack Platform

## 1. Introduction
This whitepaper outlines the security posture, design principles, and implemented controls within the dLNk Attack Platform, an AI-driven offensive security framework.

## 2. Threat Model
*   **Adversary:** External attackers, compromised internal users, malicious insiders.
*   **Attack Goals:** Unauthorized access, data exfiltration, system compromise, denial of service, platform misuse.
*   **Attack Vectors:** API exploitation, WebSocket manipulation, supply chain attacks (compromised agents/dependencies), configuration errors, social engineering (if applicable to users).

## 3. Security Design Principles
*   **Least Privilege:** Components and users operate with minimum necessary permissions.
*   **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of security controls.
*   **Secure by Design:** Security considerations integrated throughout the development lifecycle.
*   **Transparency & Auditability:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring.
*   **Resilience:** Ability to withstand and recover from attacks.

## 4. Implemented Security Controls

### 4.1. Authentication & Authorization
*   **API Key Authentication:** Strong, randomly generated API keys for all API access.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Admin and User roles with distinct permissions.
*   **JWT Authentication:** For administrative interfaces, with refresh tokens and expiration.
*   **Secure Password Hashing:** Use of strong, modern hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt/Argon2) with salt.
*   **API Key Lifecycle Management:** Creation, revocation, and deletion of API keys.

### 4.2. Input Validation & Output Encoding
*   **Pydantic Models:** Strict schema validation for API requests.
*   **Custom Validators:** URL validation (blocking private IPs, localhost) to prevent SSRF.
*   **Type Hinting:** Enhances code correctness and reduces certain classes of bugs.
*   **Output Encoding:** (To be implemented/verified) Proper encoding of user-supplied data in UI to prevent XSS.

### 4.3. Secrets Management
*   **Environment Variables:** All sensitive configurations (API keys, database credentials, LLM tokens) loaded from environment variables.
*   **Docker Secrets/Kubernetes Secrets:** Integration with platform-native secret management for production deployments.
*   **No Hardcoded Secrets:** Strict policy against hardcoding credentials or sensitive information.
*   **Secure Random Generation:** Use of `secrets` module for cryptographic randomness.

### 4.4. Network Security
*   **CORS Configuration:** Restrictive CORS policies in production to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.
*   **Rate Limiting:** API and IP-based rate limiting to mitigate brute-force and DoS attacks.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Docker networks and Kubernetes network policies to isolate services.
*   **TLS/SSL:** (To be implemented/verified) Encryption of all in-transit data (API, C2, database connections).

### 4.5. Container & Infrastructure Security
*   **Non-Root Containers:** All application containers run as non-root users.
*   **Minimal Base Images:** Use of `python:3.11-slim` for reduced attack surface.
*   **Read-Only Filesystems:** Where possible, containers run with read-only filesystems.
*   **Resource Limits:** CPU and memory limits to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
*   **Health Checks:** Robust health checks for service reliability.
*   **Image Scanning:** (To be integrated) Regular scanning of Docker images for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure Docker Socket Access:** (Critical review needed) Avoid direct mounting of `/var/run/docker.sock` where possible.

### 4.6. Logging & Monitoring
*   **Comprehensive Logging:** Detailed logs of all system activities, agent executions, and API requests.
*   **Structured Logging:** (To be implemented) Use of structured log formats for easier analysis.
*   **Real-time Log Streaming:** WebSocket-based log streaming.
*   **Centralized Monitoring:** Integration with Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and alerts.
*   **Audit Logs:** Admin activity logs for accountability.

### 4.7. Data Security
*   **Data at Rest Encryption:** (To be implemented) Encryption of sensitive data stored in the database (e.g., exfiltrated data, vulnerability details).
*   **Data in Transit Encryption:** (To be implemented/verified) Use of TLS for all network communications.
*   **Data Integrity:** Use of hashing (SHA256) for exfiltrated files.
*   **Secure Temporary Files:** Use of `tempfile` module for temporary data.

### 4.8. AI/LLM Security
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Careful crafting of prompts to prevent prompt injection attacks.
*   **Model Access Control:** Secure access to LLM services (e.g., Ollama API keys).
*   **Output Validation:** Validation of LLM outputs to prevent generation of malicious or incorrect commands.

## 5. Vulnerability Management
*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Use of `flake8`, `mypy`, `bandit` during development.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** (To be integrated) Automated security scanning of the running application.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Regular penetration tests to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** (To be integrated) Tools to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

## 6. Incident Response
*   **Logging & Alerting:** Mechanisms for detecting and alerting on suspicious activities.
*   **Forensic Readiness:** Comprehensive logs and data retention policies to aid in incident investigation.
*   **Kill Chain Integration:** Ability to stop ongoing attacks.

## 7. Legal & Ethical Considerations
*   **Offensive Tool:** Acknowledgment that the platform is an offensive tool.
*   **Responsible Use:** Emphasis on legal and ethical use, with strict internal policies.
*   **Compliance:** Adherence to relevant data protection and privacy regulations.

## 8. Conclusion
This whitepaper demonstrates the dLNk Attack Platform's commitment to security through its robust design, implemented controls, and continuous improvement processes.
